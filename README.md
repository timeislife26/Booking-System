# This was done as part of my Modular Programming Module.
The goal was to create a booking system for a caravan and camping resort.
There was 3 types of bookings and the information of the bookings was saved into two txt files (bookings_2022.txt and extras.txt).
New bookings were given a 2 digit ordering number that starts with 01 and ascends with each booking with a maximum of 30 bookings.
There is also an option to review the statistcs of all bookings made and see how many booking sites are remaining.
